This is a game for your terminal. It is a simple slot machine simulation.

How to play:

    *Compile the code (g++ main.cpp slots.cpp) and run the executable in your 
     terminal.

    *You are credited 100 tokens to start.

    *Enter the number of tokens you wish to wager. Wager rules are standard: you
     gain the amount of tokens wagered if successful, otherwise it will be 
     deducted from your total.

    *The slots will "spin" and show your results.
    
    *You can choose whether you wish to continue playing or not. If you choose
     to continue, the game will proceed until you run out of tokens.
