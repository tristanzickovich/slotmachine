This is a game for your terminal. It is a simple slot machine simulation.

How to play:

* Compile the code (g++ main.cpp slots.cpp) and run the executable in your 
     terminal.
* You are credited 100 tokens to start.
* Enter the number of tokens you wish to wager. Wager rules are standard: you
gain the amount of tokens wagered if successful, otherwise it will be 
deducted from your total.
* The slots will "spin" and show your results.
* You can choose whether you wish to continue playing or not. If you choose to continue, the game will proceed until you run out of tokens.
